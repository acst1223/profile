          <b>ByteDance - Backend Engineer Intern</b><br />
          Apr 2022 - Sept 2022<br />
          <div class="indent">
            I participated in the backend development of Ocean Engine, China's
            leading platform that provides integrated marketing and advertising
            solutions. For development, I used the Go language and the KiteX
            framework, an RPC framework based on Thrift.
          </div>
          <div class="indent">
            I improved an advertisement material service by leveraging caching
            and concurrency. As a result, the service latency was reduced by
            over 70%, and the QPS to downstream services decreased by up to 80%.
          </div>
          <div class="indent">
            I also developed new services, such as a pre-audit tool for
            advertising copies on Ocean Engine.

          <b>ByteDance - Algorithm Engineer Intern</b><br />
          July 2021 - Apr 2022<br />
          <div class="indent">
            I developed an automatic soundtracking system for text-to-speech
            audiobooks. This system could reduce the operating cost of Tomato
            Novel, China’s leading web novel platform launched by ByteDance.
          </div>
          <div class="indent">
            The evaluation result showed that the pass rate for the output
            soundtracks of the automatic system was 91.25%, only 2.50% behind
            that of the human system. The automatic system was integrated into
            the application, and the work was also accepted by INTERSPEECH 2022.

          <div class="indent">
            I did some research on log anomaly detection with RNN networks. The
            models achieved better F1-score (0.88) than traditional machine
            learning methods on BGL, an open dataset of logs collected from a
            BlueGene/L supercomputer system. The code can be found
